# Multithreaded Data Processing Application - Design Report

## Introduction
This report provides an overview of the design choices made in the multithreaded data processing application. The application is intended to efficiently process data from multiple sources concurrently. The design encompasses multithreading, synchronization, error handling, and considerations for performance.

## Multithreading Implementation
The application employs the `std::thread` class from the C++ Standard Library to create two threads, enabling concurrent processing of data from multiple sources. This design choice allows for parallel execution, potentially improving the overall performance of the data processing task.

## Synchronization Mechanism
To ensure data integrity and avoid race conditions, a `std::mutex` (mutual exclusion) is used as the synchronization mechanism. The `std::lock_guard` is employed to automatically manage the locking and unlocking of the mutex, providing a simple and effective means of synchronizing access to the shared `processedData` vector.

## Error Handling
Proper error handling is implemented for file opening operations. If a file cannot be opened, an error message is displayed, providing useful information for debugging. This design choice enhances the robustness of the application by gracefully handling potential issues with input files.

## Performance Considerations
The current implementation focuses on basic multithreading concepts. Depending on the specific requirements of the real-time data processing task, further optimizations can be explored. Considerations such as load balancing, efficient data structures, and advanced thread management techniques may be applied to achieve optimal performance in more complex scenarios.

## Conclusion
The multithreaded data processing application is designed to balance efficiency and simplicity. The chosen design leverages standard C++ features to implement multithreading, synchronization, and error handling. This report provides an overview of the design choices made, with considerations for potential optimizations in real-world applications.
