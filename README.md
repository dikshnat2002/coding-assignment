# Multithreaded Data Processing Application

## Overview
This C++ application is designed to efficiently process data from multiple sources concurrently using multithreading. It employs synchronization mechanisms to ensure data integrity and avoids race conditions. The README provides instructions on how to compile and run the code.

## Instructions
Follow these steps to compile and run the application:

1. **Download the Source Code:**
   - Copy the provided C++ source code into a file, for example, `multithreaded_app.cpp`.

2. **Compile the Code:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing your source code file.
   - Use a C++ compiler to compile the code. For example:
     ```bash
     # On Linux
     g++ -o multithreaded_app multithreaded_app.cpp -std=c++11 -pthread

     # On Windows (assuming MinGW is installed)
     g++ -o multithreaded_app.exe multithreaded_app.cpp -std=c++11 -pthread
     ```
   - Replace `multithreaded_app` with the desired output executable name.

3. **Run the Executable:**
   - Execute the compiled program:
     ```bash
     # On Linux
     ./multithreaded_app

     # On Windows
     multithreaded_app.exe
     ```

4. **Review the Processed Data:**
   - After the program completes, it will print the processed data to the console.

## Design Choices
- **Multithreading Implementation:**
  - Two threads are created to concurrently process data from multiple sources.

- **Synchronization Mechanism:**
  - A `std::mutex` is used for synchronization to ensure data integrity.
  - `std::lock_guard` is employed to automatically lock and unlock the mutex, providing safe access to the shared resource.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Proper error handling is implemented for file opening to handle potential issues with reading input files.

- **Performance Considerations:**
  - The example focuses on basic multithreading. Depending on specific requirements, further optimizations, load balancing, and efficient data structures can be explored for improved performance.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
- The `-std=c++11` flag is used for C++11 standard compliance.
- The `-pthread` flag is used to link the POSIX threads library.
